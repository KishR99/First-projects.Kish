                <h3>About Dudley</h3>
                <h4>Dudley is one of four council areas within the Black country. The name has been in use since the mid-19th century and is thought to refer to the colour of the coal seam or the air pollution from the many thousands of foundries and factories around at the time; in 1862, Elihu Burritt famously described the area as being 'black by day and red by night'</h4>
